# Project Title
Weather App

## Description
- The application aims to make use of async await and promises to  handle asynchronous data fetching from an API.
- While the data is being fetched, a progress bar shows the percentage completed.
- We fetch the data from a publicly available api.


## Project Instructions:

- Set up a blank HTML document with the appropriate links to your JavaScript and CSS files.
- Write the functions that hit the API. You’re going to want functions that can take a location and return the weather data for that location. For now, just console.log() the information.
- Write the functions that process the JSON data you’re getting from the API and return an object with only the data you require for your app.
- Set up a form that will let users input their location and will fetch the weather info (still just console.log() it).
- Display the information on your webpage!
- Add any styling you like!
- * Optional: add a ‘loading’ component that displays from the time the form is submitted until the information comes back from the API. Use DevTools to test for low-end devices.
_ * Push that baby to github and share your solution below!


## Testing the API
- Into the input field, enter the name of a location such as "london"
- Hit "Submit" to see the returned data
